11/22 8:00pm - 11/23 12:00pm
    Implemented window class, main loop, rotating crosshairs etc.

11/23 9:15pm - 11/24 2:00pm

11/24:11:30pm - 11/25 5:15 pm
    Implemented virual system class, viruses now steal files indexed from
    home directory.  Also made viruses disappear and respawn if clicked on
    (ie. click handling).  Power up class started, as well as the statTracker
    class to record user statics

11/26 2:45pm - 11/27 12:00pm
    Finished all of the power ups and statTracker.  Implemented overlays (ie
    main menu, game over, and next level screens).  Learned pygame mixer
    and implemented sound

11/28 10:00pm - 11/29 12:00am
    Polished graphics and fixed various bugs

11/30 9:00pm - 11/30 10:00pm
    Implemented Debug Mode.  Switched all print statments to log statements, 
    also made game compatible with Windows

12/2 8:30pm - 12/2 10:00pm
    More debugging.  Made sure comments were coherent

12/4 11:30am - 11/4 10:00pm
    Recorded video of game and converted from .ogv file to .avi file (WORST
    EXPERIENCE EVER) and created video in Adobe Premiere in CFA.  Found out that
    AFS doesn't give students enough room to render video onto server

12/5 9:30pm - 12/6 12:00am
    Rendered video to external hard drive - had to re-adjust all of the sound
    because OS X doesn't write to NTFS partitions... And Adobe Premiere for OS X
    and for Windows don't cooperate

12/6 12:am - 12/6 3:00am
    Wrote documentation for game
