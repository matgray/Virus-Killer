<p>VIRUS KILLER</p>

<p>COPYRIGHT:

<p>Ultimately the aim of the game is to score as many points and survive 
as many rounds as possible. Points are scored by destroying viruses.</p>

<p>Viruses will stream in each round from the various virus-prone applications 
at the top of the screen and begin to make their way towards your directories 
at the bottom. Viruses can be destroyed by firing your kernel laser at them. 
This laser power is limited and decreases as the laser is fired. Once the power
is exhausted you must wait for it to charge up again. The laser recharges 
whenever it is not being fired.</p>
