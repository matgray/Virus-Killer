Points are scored by destroying viruses.\r\n\r\nViruses will stream in each round from the various virus-prone applications \r\nat the top of the screen and begin to make their way towards your directories \r\nat the bottom. Viruses can be destroyed by firing your kernel laser at them. \r\nThis laser power is limited and decreases as the laser is fired. Once the power\r\nis exhausted you must wait for it to charge up again. The laser recharges \r\nwhenever it is not being fired.\r\n\r\nINSTALLATION:\r\n\r\n\tINSTALLATION FOR DEBIAN-BASED LINUX DISTRIBUTIONS:\r\n\r\n\t\tIn terminal type the following (required su privileges)\r\n\r\n\t\t$ sudo apt-get install python\r\n\t\t$ sudo apt-get install python-pygame\r\n\t\r\n\tINSTALLATION FOR OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS:\r\n\r\n\t\tYou MUST have Python 2.7 installed as well as pygame:\r\n\r\n\t\tPython 2.7:\r\n\t\thttp://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7/\r\n\t\t\r\n        Pygame for Python 2.7: \r\n        (Make sure to download pygame for python 2.7 for\r\n        appropriate architecture)\r\n\t\t\r\n        http://pygame.org/download.shtml\r\n\r\nAfter you install Python 2.7 and Pygame for Python 2.7, you can run VirusKiller\r\nThis can be done by using terminal (or Microsoft equivalent) to cd into \r\nVirusKiller's directory, then by typing:\r\n$ python virusKiller.py\r\n\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
